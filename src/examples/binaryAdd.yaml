  # Adds two binary numbers together.

  # Format: Given input a+b where a and b are binary numbers,
  # leaves c b on the tape, where c = a+b.
  # Example: '11+1' => '100 1'.
  input: '1011+11001'

  # Exercise:

  # • Generate the Fibonacci sequence in binary, listed from right to left:
  #   ...1101 1000 101 11 10 1 1 0
  #   Hint: prefix the current number with a +, copy the previous number
  #   and place it left of the +, run the adder, and repeat.
  #   Example: '1 0' => '+1 0' => '0+1 0' => '1 1 0' => '+1 1 0' => ...
